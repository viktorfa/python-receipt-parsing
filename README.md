# python-receipt-parsing

Project with the goal of creating structured data from (grocery) receipts. Made with [Google Cloud Vision](https://cloud.google.com/vision/) as OCR service in mind. Can theoretically work with any OCR that annotates text in rectangles.

Main focus is being able to extract information about the products bought in a receipt; such as price, description, unit price, quantity, etc...
